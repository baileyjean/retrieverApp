## Description
**Retriever App** is an app for posting and *retrieving* rescue animals, with a specific focus on exotic pets. While current apps on the market serve a similar purpose to **Retriever**, those apps are primarily marketed towards the most common pets: cats and dogs. Our app is going to fill a void in the market by serving underappreciated pets!

## Tech Used
PostreSQL | Express | React.js | Node.js | JavaScript (ES6) | HTML5 | CSS3
